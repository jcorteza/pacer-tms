### What is PACER TMS ?
*PACER* is an application that can manage complex inventory system. Its capabilities extend from simple material movemnets to detailed inventory control with unique identifiers for each product. This Version of the application was created with *Pipe Companies in Mind*. The application can be customized and grown to the necesoties of each company.

### How it works ...

After an account is created,  the manager will be in charge of assign account to each individual that need access to *PACER* with the access right reuired that each individual needs. There are three types of accounts created so far on *PACER*:
